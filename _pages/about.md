I’m Kushal, an AI researcher working on Deep Learning on Graphs. I am also interested in handling data in non-Euclidean spaces. 

I’m currently a final year CS PhD student at the Indian Statistical Institute, supervised by [Prof. Swagatam Das](https://www2.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). During my Phd tenure, I have worked on various problems in long-range interactions like Oversmoothing, Oversqaushing, and Heterophily.

News
=====
1. Our joint work titled **FairSplit: Mitigating Bias in Graph Neural Networks through Sensitivity-based Edge Partitioning** accepted in the ACM CIKM 2025 in the short research paper category track.
2. Our joint work titled **Can Graph Neural Networks Tackle Heterophily? Yes, With a Label-Guided Graph Rewiring Approach!** accepted in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems  (TNNLS).  

Research Interests

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
