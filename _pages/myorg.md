Our organisation **Neulearn.ai** is dedicated to performing research beyond the Large Language Models. We believe artificial general intelligence or AGI can be achieved by going beyond LLMs. Our primary target is to design learning algorithms and intelligent systems that possess the true characteristics of human-level cognition. 

The following papers can act as a good starter pack to accomplish the mission.

1. Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00663)
2. Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architecture [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24695)
3. It’s All Connected: A Journey Through Test-Time Memorization, Attentional Bias, Retention, and Online Optimization [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13173)
4. Memory-Based Sequential Attention [[paper]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v226/stock24a/stock24a.pdf)
5. A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence (JEPA) [[paper]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf)
